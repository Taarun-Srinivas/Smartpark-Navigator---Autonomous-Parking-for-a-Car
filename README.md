# Smartpark-Navigator---Autonomous-Parking-for-a-Car

# Brief Idea
The primary focus of the project is to create a reliable and effective parking system that can enhance the parking experience for users. With the growing number of vehicles on the road, parking has become a significant issue, especially in busy areas such as garages. Our solution aims to address this challenge by leveraging the capabilities of a robot that can navigate through the lanes and locate empty parking spaces. By doing so, the system will improve the efficiency of parking, reduce the time spent searching for a spot, and ultimately enhance the user's overall experience.
